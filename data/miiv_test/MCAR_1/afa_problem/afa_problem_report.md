\usepackage{longtable}\paragraph{The AFA problem}
The AFA problem is to decide what groups of features to acquire to solve the prediction problem. Feature Acquisition actions produce a cost. These are the options: 
\begin{itemize}
\item acquire_CBC
\begin{itemize}
\item target_superfeatures: ['CBC']
\item cost: 26.0
\item resolution: 1.0
\item delay: 1.0
\end{itemize}
\item acquire_CBC+diff
\begin{itemize}
\item target_superfeatures: ['CBC', 'diff_from_CBC']
\item cost: 35.0
\item resolution: 1.0
\item delay: 0.0
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
